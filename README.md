# OpenElections Data Ohio

This repository contains pre-processed election results from Ohio, formatted to be ingested into the OpenElections [processing pipeline](http://docs.openelections.net/guide/). It contains mostly CSV files converted from HTML tables. Interested in contributing? We have a bunch of [easy tasks](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-oh/labels/easy%20task) for you to tackle.

Here is what a [finished CSV file](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-oh/blob/master/2000/20001107__oh__general__president.csv) looks like. Note that each row represents a single result for a single candidate, even if the data has multiple candidates in a single row. Also, vote totals do not contain commas or other formatting.

If you're familiar with git and Github, clone this repository and get started. If not, you can still help: leave a comment on a task you'd like to work on, or just convert any of the files into CSV and send the result to openelections@gmail.com.
